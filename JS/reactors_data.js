/* Max age for Hinkley Point C is 60 years old (They will definetly push it to 65 though, for sure xDD) [gov.uk Hicley Point C report downloaded]
Hinkley-Point-C is operational on 2025 Nov ([gov.uk Hicley Point C report downloaded] said that end of 2025) => 717 days
Assume Sizwell-B is 60 years old as well, Decision sometime in 2024 (find some source) (assume nov 2024), Assume wil take 8 years to build. Hence: 352 + 7 * 365
